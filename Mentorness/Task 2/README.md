# Project Name: Sales Forecasting for Furniture Store

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to accurately forecast future sales
for a furniture store based on historical data. The dataset includes various features such as order
details, customer information, product categories, and sales performance. By analyzing these
features, the model will predict future sales trends, which can help the store in inventory
management, marketing strategies, and financial planning.
